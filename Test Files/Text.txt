Google was officially launched in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to market Google 
Search, which has become the most used web-based search engine. Larry Page and 
Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California, developed a search algorithm 
first (1996) known as "BackRub", with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg. 
The search engine soon proved successful, and the expanding company moved several 
times, finally settling at Mountain View in 2003. This marked a phase of rapid growth, 
with the company making its initial public offering in 2004 and quickly becoming one of 
the world's largest media companies. The company launched Google News in 2002, 
Gmail in 2004, Google Maps in 2005, Google Chrome in 2008, and the social network 
known as Google+ in 2011 (which was shut down in April 2019), in addition to many 
other products. In 2015, Google became the main subsidiary of the holding company 
Alphabet Inc.
